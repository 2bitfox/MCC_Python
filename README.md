# MCC_Python

A python class I created for personal use, to access [Noxcrew's MCC api](https://github.com/Noxcrew/mcchampionship-api) through python

I'll write a better readme later. remind me to fill this out more

## mcc.py

The class itself which directly calls the public API. It's current functions allow the user to pull data from the API into another file.

## mcc_data.py

My own example / playing around with the data, and graphing it with plotly.

An example of the data from yellow tean (their total coin counts) from MCC pride 22. This is the current output of this file
